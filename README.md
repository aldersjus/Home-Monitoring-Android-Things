# Home-Monitoring-Android-Things
Using Android Things with a PIR sensor to record movement and upload to Firebase.

Continuation of my home monitor system. I was exploring the possibility of using Android Things
for this project. I created this simple app to test this. The app senses motion lights up LEDs
to show motion and updates Google Firebase real time database with the latest movement. I was
thinking of creating a companion Flutter app to display the data.
